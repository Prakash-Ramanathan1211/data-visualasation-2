        From the mid-1980 to June 2003, the price of barrel of crude oil was generally under US$25/barrel. During 2003, the price rose above $30 and reached the peak in July 2008. There are many reasons for the price rising including the middle East tension, soaring demand from China, the falling value of the US dollar. In late 2008, the oil prices collapsed. It may be caused by some geopolitical events and natural disasters like North Korean missile tests, Hurricane Katrina. However, the supply and demand of oil should also be responsible for the recession. Oil price stabilized by August 2009 and remained in a trading range between $70 and $120 through the end of 2014. Until 2014, the oil price experienced another steep drop. Economies in countries like Chine, Russia, India began to slow after 2010. Their lower oil demand brought the oil price down. At the same time, countries such as U.S and Canada increased their efforts to produce oil. The two countries cut their oil imports and thus put further downward pressure on world prices.

        The price of the petroleum products show a very similar track as the crude oil. This is intuitive. Since the petroleum products are extracted from crude oil, the supply and demand of crude  oil is the same as the demand and supply of petroleum products. We also notice that the price of the products in different areas are similar and among all the petroleum products, Propane is the cheapest.
